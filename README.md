### Geo Artificial Intelligence thermobArometry
Deep learning artificial neural network for P-T estimates of volcano plumbing systems using clinopyroxene composition.

#### The Project
The anatomy of the plumbing system of active volcanoes is fundamental to understanding how magma is stored and channeled to the surface. Reliable geothermobarometric estimates are, therefore, critical to assess the depths and temperatures of the complex system of magmatic reservoirs that form a volcano apparatus. Here, we developed a novel Machine Learning approach based upon Feedforward Neural Networks (GAIA) to estimate P-T conditions of magma storage and migration within the crust. Our Feedforward Neural Network method applied to clinopyroxene compositions yields better uncertainties (Root-Mean-Square Error and R2 score) than previous Machine Learning methods and set the basis for a novel generation of reliable geothermobarometers, which extends beyond the paradigm associated to crystal-liquid equilibrium. Also, the bootstrap procedure, inherent to the Feedforward Neural Network architecture, permits to perform a rigorous assessment of the P-T uncertainty associated to each clinopyroxene composition, as opposed to the Root-Mean-Square Error representing the P-T uncertainty of whole set of clinopyroxene compositions.

The project was born from the collaboration between the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Earth Sciences of the University of Firenze, Italy. See the info page for details on people who developed the app.

### The App

A web App has been developed to make it easy to use our new model (https://gaia-geothermobarometry-gaia-home-6ol8kg.streamlit.app/). This repository hosts the app code.
